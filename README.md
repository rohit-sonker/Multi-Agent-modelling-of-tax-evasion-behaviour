# Multi-Agent-modelling-of-tax-evasion-behaviour

Tax compliance rates by small business owners ismodeled in an agent-based framework. It
is modeled as a repeated game between government who operates through tax collectors
and tax payers. 

The taxpayers (business owners) display 3 major types of behaviours Honest,
Strategic, Defiant; defined by the amount of income they reveal. Themodel is used to simulate
changes in a static population of 10,000 taxpayers. 

A simulation using realistic parameters
for the probability of audit and penalty rate finds that after seventy five time periods, the
initial number of Honest business owners declines and the number of Defiant business owners
emerges as a majority.
